# LSTM-Language-Model-with-Noise-Contrastive-Estimation
A Language Model built using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for solving the problem of vanishing gradients. Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) is used in the output layer to avoid the softmax normalization, which reduces the computation time.

I personally use Anaconda, which installs most of the packages that one may require for coding in Python. Still, if you want to install Theano and Lasagne manually, the links for step-by-step installation are provided below.

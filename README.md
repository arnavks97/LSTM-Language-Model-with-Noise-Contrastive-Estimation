# LSTM-Language-Model-with-Noise-Contrastive-Estimation
A Language Model built using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for solving the problem of vanishing gradients. Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) is used in the output layer to avoid the softmax normalization, which reduces the computation time.
